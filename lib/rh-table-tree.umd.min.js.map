The `this` context and all arguments are passed through, as-is,\n *                                  to `callback` when the debounced-function is executed.\n *\n * @returns {Function} A new, debounced function.\n */\n\nfunction debounce (delay, atBegin, callback) {\n  return callback === undefined ?
